Dear CrystFEL users and interested crystallographers,

CrystFEL version 0.10.0 has been released!

This is a huge update to CrystFEL, adding a completely new graphical user
interface (GUI) which makes it much easier to interact with your data, guiding
you through the processing steps.  To give a preview of the GUI and help you
get started, I've made a video tutorial to accompany this release:
https://www.desy.de/~twhite/crystfel/presentations.html

Electron diffraction is fully supported in this version of CrystFEL.  Amongst
other things, you can now specify an electron accelerating voltage (instead of
an X-ray photon energy) in the geometry file.  Combined with the 'diffractem'
pre-processing software developed by the Max Planck Institute for the Structure
and Dynamics of Matter, you have a complete solution for processing data from
serial electron diffraction crystallography.  For more details, see:
https://gitlab.desy.de/thomas.white/crystfel/-/blob/master/doc/articles/electrons.rst

In addition, I've taken advantage of the extended quiet time to work on many
internal parts of CrystFEL.  The most noticable benefit of this is that several
parts of CrystFEL are now much faster.

Some command-line parameters and geometry file directives have changed, but you
should find that the error messages will direct you towards what needs to be
updated.

See the release notes and the ChangeLog for full details of the other
improvements.
