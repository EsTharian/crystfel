Dear CrystFEL users and interested crystallographers,

An early Christmas present for you all, as CrystFEL version 0.8.0 has been
released.

This new version adds a powerful new indexing algorithm, more stable B-factors
when merging and rejection of rogue patterns via "delta CChalf".  Besides those,
there are several other exciting features such as an option to wait for files
to appear on disk (useful for certain automated processing environments).
In addition, the pixelmap creation utility (make_pixelmap) has become a core
CrystFEL program with this release.

Note that the build system has changed from GNU autotools ("./configure") to
CMake.  The README file has instructions for how to compile and install.

See the release notes for more discussion of these improvements, and the
ChangeLog for full details of the other improvements.

Thanks for all of your past and future feedback and contributions, and
your continued use of CrystFEL.  As ever, please contact me directly if
you would prefer to be unsubscribed from this mailing list.
