Dear CrystFEL users and interested crystallographers,

CrystFEL version 0.9.0 has been released!

This release adds a new indexing method ("PinkIndexer") and improvements to
reflection prediction which will enable data processing for wide bandwidth and
electron diffraction experiments.

A new core program has been added, "cell_tool", which can perform several
useful tasks on unit cells such as transformation, finding indexing ambiguities
and calculating power ring positions.

There have been many other improvements across the whole suite.  Notably,
CBFlib is no longer required by CrystFEL, manual resolution limits are no
longer needed by ambigator, and "--no-cell-combinations" is no longer needed by
indexamajig.

See the release notes for more discussion of these improvements, and the
ChangeLog for full details of the other improvements.

Thanks for all of your past and future feedback and contributions, and
your continued use of CrystFEL.  As ever, please contact me directly if
you would prefer to be unsubscribed from this mailing list.
