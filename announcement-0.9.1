Dear CrystFEL users and interested crystallographers,

CrystFEL version 0.9.1 has been released!

This is a maintenance and bug-fixing release which fixes a few problems which
crept into version 0.9.0.  The most important fixes are:

1. The unit cell comparision function, which was completely re-written for
   CrystFEL 0.9.0, was updated to fix a mis-indexing problem with certain
   types of unit cell.  This may increase indexing rate or fix wrong output
   cells in those cases.

2. The default unit cell angle tolerance, which was accidentally set to
   1.5 radians in CrystFEL 0.9.0 as a result of the above changes,
   was re-set to 1.5 degrees.

3. Build compatability was added with very new HDF5 versions (>= 1.12) and
   older versions of zlib (< 1.2.3.5).

See the release notes and the ChangeLog for full details of the other
improvements.
