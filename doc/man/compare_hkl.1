.TH COMPARE_HKL 1
.SH NAME
compare_hkl \- compare reflection data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcompare_hkl\fR \fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB...\fR \fIfile1.hkl\fR \fIfile2.hkl\fR
.PP
\fBcompare_hkl --help\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
compare_hkl compares two sets of reflection data and calculates figures of merit such as R-factors.  Reflections will be considered equivalent according to your choice of point group.

.SH OPTIONS
.PD 0
.IP \fB-y\fR \fpointgroup\fR
.IP \fB--symmetry=\fR\fIpointgroup\fR
.PD
Specify the symmetry of the reflections.  The symmetry must be the same for both lists of reflections.  Default: 1 (no symmetry).

.PD 0
.IP \fB-p\fR \fIunitcell.pdb\fR
.IP \fB--pdb=\fR\fIunitcell.pdb\fR
.PD
Specify the name of the PDB file containing at least a CRYST1 line describing the unit cell.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--fom=\fR\fIFoM\fR
.PD
Calculate figure of merit \fIFoM\fR.  Possible figures of merit are:
.RS
.IP \fBRsplit\fR
.PD
2^(-0.5) * sum(I1-kI2) / [ 0.5*sum(I1+kI2) ]
.IP \fBR1f\fR
.PD
sum(sqrt(I1)-sqrt(kI2)) / sum(sqrt(I1))
.IP \fBR1i\fR
.PD
sum(I1-kI2) / sum(I1)
.IP \fBR2\fR
.PD
sqrt(sum[(I1-kI2)^2] / sum(I1^2))
.IP \fBCC\fR
.PD
The Pearson correlation coefficient.
.IP \fBCC*\fR
.PD
The value "CC*", see Karplus and Diederichs, Science 336 (2012) p1030.
.PP
I1 and I2 are the intensities of the same reflection in both reflection lists.  The scale factor, k, is given by sum(i1*i2) / sum(i2^2), unless you use \fB-u\fR.
.RE

.PD 0
.IP \fB-u\fR
.PD
Fix scale factors to unity.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--nshells=\fR\fIn\fR
.PD
Use \fIn\fR resolution shells.  Default: 10.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--shell-file=\fIfilename\fR
.PD
Write the figure of merit in resolution shells to \fIfilename\fR.  Default: "shells.dat".

.PD 0
.IP \fB--ignore-negs\fR
.PD
Ignore reflections with negative intensities.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--zero-negs\fR
.PD
Set to zero the intensities of reflections with negative intensities.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--sigma-cutoff=\fR\fIn\fR
.PD
Discard reflections with I/sigma(I) < \fIn\fR.  Default: -infinity (no cutoff).

.PD 0
.IP \fB--rmin=\fR\fI1/d\fR
.PD
Discard reflections with lower than this value of 1/d in m^-1.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--rmax=\fR\fI1/d\fR
.PD
Discard reflections with higher than this value of 1/d in m^-1.
