.TH CHECK_HKL 1
.SH NAME
check_hkl \- calculate figures of merit for reflection data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcheck_hkl\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB...\fR \fIfile.hkl\fR \fB-p\fR \fIcell.pdb\fR
.PP
\fBcheck_hkl --help\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
check_hkl calculates figures of merit for reflection data, such as completeness and average signal strengths, in resolution shells.  check_hkl accepts a single reflection list in CrystFEL's format, and you must also provide a unit cell (in a PDB file).

.SH OPTIONS
.PD 0
.IP \fB-p\fR \fIunitcell.pdb\fR
.IP \fB--pdb=\fR\fIunitcell.pdb\fR
.PD
Specify the name of the PDB file containing at least a CRYST1 line describing the unit cell.

.PD 0
.IP \fB-y\fR \fpointgroup\fR
.IP \fB--symmetry=\fR\fIpointgroup\fR
.PD
Specify the symmetry of the reflections.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--sigma-cutoff=\fR\fIn\fR
.PD
Discard reflections with I/sigma(I) < \fIn\fR.  Default: -infinity (no cutoff).

.PD 0
.IP \fB-p\fR \fIunitcell.pdb\fR
.IP \fB--pdb=\fR\fIunitcell.pdb\fR
.PD
Specify the name of the PDB file containing at least a CRYST1 line describing the unit cell.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--rmin=\fR\fI1/d\fR
.PD
Fix the lower resolution limit for the resolutions shells, as 1/d in m^-1.

.PD 0
.IP \fB--rmax=\fR\fI1/d\fR
.PD
Fix the upper resolution limit for the resolutions shells, as 1/d in m^-1.
