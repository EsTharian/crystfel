CrystFEL stream format
----------------------

num_peaks: The number of peaks accepted for indexing.  If you used
  "--use-saturated", this includes the saturated peaks which are also counted by
  num_saturated_peaks.  If you didn't, then it doesn't.

num_saturated_peaks: The number of saturated peaks, regardless of whether or not
  they were used for indexing (see --use-saturated).

num_saturated_reflections: The number of saturated reflections, regardless of
  whether or not they were included in the reflection list
  (see --integrate-saturated).  Reflections which could not be integrated for
  some other reason, e.g. because they were close to a panel edge or hit a bad
  region, are NOT included in this count.
