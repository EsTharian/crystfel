Overview
--------

This is a maintenance and bug-fixing release which fixes a few issues which
crept into CrystFEL 0.9.0.  Here are the detils, in roughly decreasing
order of importance:

1. The unit cell comparision function, which was completely re-written for
   CrystFEL 0.9.0, was updated to fix a mis-indexing problem with certain
   types of unit cell.  This may increase indexing rate or fix wrong output
   cells in those cases.

2. The default unit cell angle tolerance, which was accidentally set to
   1.5 radians in CrystFEL 0.9.0, was re-set to 1.5 degrees.

3. Build compatability was added with very new HDF5 versions (>= 1.12) and
   older versions of zlib (< 1.2.3.5).

4. A problem was fixed in indexamajig when reading metadata from certain
   HDF5 structures (arrays of fixed length strings).

5. The sigma(I) estimates for very weakly negative (unmerged) reflections
   were improved.

6. PinkIndexer logic fixes and documentation improvements, and addition of
   "--pinkIndexer-max-refinement-disbalance" option to indexamajig.

7. General documentation improvements.

For your convenience, the announcement and release notes for the previous
version (CrystFEL 0.9.0) have been included with version 0.9.1.  If you're
upgrading from CrystFEL 0.8.0, you should check those files as well.
As always, you can find more details in the "ChangeLog" or the changes page
on the CrystFEL website.
