CrystFEL version 0.4.2, 2nd October 2012
----------------------------------------

- A data quality regression, introduced between versions 0.3.0 and 0.4.0, was
  fixed.
- A speed regression, introduced at the same time as the data quality
  regression, was also fixed (approximately a factor of 2 speed increase with
  indexamajig).
- Centered unit cells are now handled correctly during unit cell reduction.
- The same colour scale is now used for every panel by hdfsee.
- "get_hkl -w" was fixed.
- A spurious "-p" option was removed from scripts/gen-sfs-ano.
- Option handling across all programs was fixed to prevent confusion.


CrystFEL version 0.4.1, 29th August 2012
----------------------------------------

- Some compiler warnings with newer versions of GCC were fixed.
- Bad pixels are now shown in brown by hdfsee.
- Bad pixels are now ignored when calculating the range of the image for the
  colour scale in hdfsee.
- A crash when there were too many unit cell candidates was fixed.
- Small typos were fixed in a warning message and pattern_sim(1).
- "indexamajig --image" was fixed.


CrystFEL version 0.4.0, 31st July 2012
--------------------------------------

- Performance increase when using indexamajig on multi-core hardware (Chun Hong
  Yoon).
- "max_adu" field was added to geometry file format.
- Added masking of inner ("peak") regions of all peaks during the background
  calculation (Kenneth Beyerlein).
- Bandwidth and subsampling was restored to the GPU version of pattern_sim.
- Spot prediction and associated partiality calculations were improved.
- "profile_radius" field was added to beam file format.
- "compare_hkl --shells" now uses separate denominators in each resolution bin
  for the R-factor calculation.
- Removed fields "peak_sep" and "integr_radius" in geometry files.
- Bug fix for process_hkl --histogram (Lorenzo Galli).
- A bug was fixed in find_panel().
- Improvements were made to the build system.
- "indexamajig --min-integration-snr" was fixed.
- Fixed "process_hkl --start-after" and "--stop-after".
- "compare_hkl --sigma-cutoff" added.
- Shell resolutions in Angstroms added to the shells files of check_hkl and
  compare_hkl.
- Fixed small compilation problem with Cairo < 1.6.
- The tolerances for the cell reduction procedure, "ltl" in match_cell(), is now
  "const float *ltl" instead of just "float *ltl".
- The "peak_sep" field of "struct panel" was removed, and "max_adu" added.
- "struct beam_parameters" now contains a new field: "profile_radius".
- "write_detector_geometry()" was added to detector.h.
- "hdf5_write_image()" was added to hdf5-file.h.


CrystFEL version 0.3.0, 14th March 2012
---------------------------------------

- Initial release of CrystFEL.
