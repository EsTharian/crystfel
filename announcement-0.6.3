Dear CrystFEL users and interested crystallographers,

It's been a long time since the last CrystFEL release, but we have not been
resting.  CrystFEL version 0.6.3 has been released.

This version incorporates a large number of "backstage" improvements and
alterations.  The most interesting changes for users are:

- The incorporation of "peak finder 8" from Cheetah (also used in OnDA)

- Support for images in CBF format

- Incorporation of "TakeTwo" indexing algorithm

- Hit finder functionality (skip frames with few peaks)

- Better support for three-dimensional detector geometries

See the release notes for more discussion of these improvements, and the
ChangeLog for full details of the other improvements.

Thanks for all of your past and future feedback and contributions, and
your continued use of CrystFEL.  As ever, please contact me directly if
you would prefer to be unsubscribed from this mailing list.
